# CCMA Credit Union
# Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to classify individuals into credit score brackets based on their credit-related information. The model is implemented in Python and utilizes data retrieved from Spark. The project follows a systematic approach encompassing data preprocessing, model initialization, training, evaluation, optimization, and documentation.

# Implementation Details

**Programming Language:** Python

**Data Retrieval:** Spark

**Model Type:** Classification

**Evaluation Metrics:** Classification Accuracy

**Optimization Approach:** Iterative changes documented for performance enhancement

# Data Preparation
### Data Retrieval
The dataset was obtained from Kaggle and consists of credit-related factors used in our prediction.
### Data Loading
The data was read into a Spark DataFrame using the 'spark.read.csv()' method.
### Data Cleaning
The data was evaluated for missing values and were dropped using 'dropna()' method.
### Data Visualizations
Visualizations were created to analyze the distribution of key features and identify any patterns in the data.
